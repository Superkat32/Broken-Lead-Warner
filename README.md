# Broken-Lead-Warner
A simple Minecraft mod that warns you if your lead breaks! You can change a few settings to adjust it to the way you like!

**Requires the Fabric API.**  
Mod Menu is required if you want to change the config.

**Huge thanks** to Enriath for making the mod work in multiplayer. You can find her GitHub [here!](https://github.com/Enriath)
